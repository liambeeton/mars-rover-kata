<h1 align="center">🚀 Mars Rover Kata</h1>

A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars.

This plateau, which is curiously rectangular, must be navigated by the rovers so that their on board cameras can get a complete view of the surrounding terrain to send back to Earth.

A rover's position is represented by a combination of an x and y co-ordinates and a letter representing one of the four cardinal compass points. The plateau is divided up into a grid to simplify navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the rover is in the bottom left corner and facing North.

In order to control a rover, NASA sends a simple string of letters. The possible letters are 'L', 'R' and 'M'. 'L' and 'R' makes the rover spin 90 degrees left or right respectively, without moving from its current spot.

'M' means move forward one grid point, and maintain the same heading.

Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).

2. **`/test`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3. **`.editorconfig`**: This file helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs.

4. **`.gitattributes`**: This file allows you to specify the files and paths attributes that should be used by git when performing git actions, such as git commit, etc.

5. **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

6. **`MarsRover.Kata.sln`**: This file is used to load the information associated with the solution such as projects and any other required information.
